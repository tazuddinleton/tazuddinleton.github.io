During my time as Kaz Software, I contributed to the development and enhancement of their [Tax Research Platform](https://research.ibfd.org/), a globally recognized resource for tax professionals, governments, and multinational corporations. As a Full-Stack Developer, I worked on designing and optimizing web-based solutions that provided in-depth tax research, legal analysis, and compliance tools.

Here is what is did :

- Led the upgrade and performance improvement efforts for an Angular-based tax research platform. 
- Introduced lazy loading and modular breakdown to reduce bundle size and improve performance. 
- Used Lighthouse to monitor and benchmark performance improvements, resulting in significant reduction in 
loading times. 
- Mentored junior developers and conducted code reviews to ensure code quality and best practices. 
- Developed feasibility studies and proof of concepts (POCs) to explore new features and technologies. 
- Developed API that retrieves data from the Oracle Endeca backend service, replacing original IDs with fake, 
alphanumeric 6-digit IDs. 
- Created ID generation module that generates unique 6-digit alphanumeric IDs for each Endeca ID. 
- Implemented caching to store already generated fake IDs, reducing database queries and improving 
performance. 
- Redesigned document comparison and data visualization features, improving usability and delivering a seamless 
user experience. Implemented interactive coach marks to streamline onboarding, guiding users through key 
functionalities with clarity and ease. 
- Wrote comprehensive unit tests to ensure the functionality and reliability of the API and ID generation module.
