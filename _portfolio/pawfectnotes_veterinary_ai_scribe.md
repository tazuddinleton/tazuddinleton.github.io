[Pawfectnotes](https://www.pawfectnotes.com/) is a veterinary AI scribe designed to assist veterinarians by converting speech to text, enabling the efficient creation of SOAP notes and customer discharge notes. The app offers seamless cloud integration and features a companion browser extension for Electronic Medical Records (EMR), streamlining workflows for veterinary professionals.

I connected with the owner on Upwork and developed a strong professional relationship throughout the project. Initially focused on integrating a speech recognition service, the work evolved into a multi-milestone collaboration.

As a full-stack developer, I contributed to Pawfectnotes by:

- Integrating advanced AI Speech Recognition Services to enhance note-taking capabilities.
- Establishing connections with various veterinary platforms and service providers to improve interoperability.
- Enhancing and fixing functionalities in their  [Cloud EMR Companion (Browser Extension)](https://www.pawfectnotes.com/product/software/companion), ensuring a smoother user experience.


This project allowed me to support a valuable tool in the veterinary field while building a successful partnership with the client.
