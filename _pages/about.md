Hi, I’m Taz—a passionate software engineer with over 8 years of experience developing cutting-edge enterprise web applications. My journey in tech has led me to work on diverse projects, including Fin-Tech platforms, ERP systems, EIMS, geotechnical reporting systems, and SaaS applications.

I specialize in back-end development and have a knack for crafting robust, scalable, and efficient solutions. Whether I’m building complex microservices, optimizing database queries, or integrating systems seamlessly, I thrive on turning challenges into opportunities.

I’m currently diving into freelance opportunities, where I bring my expertise in technologies like ASP.NET, Entity Framework, PostgreSQL, and JavaScript frameworks to help businesses achieve their goals. Alongside freelancing, I’m also completing my BSc in Computer Science and Engineering to solidify my academic foundation.

When I’m not coding, you’ll find me exploring emerging tech trends, mentoring junior developers, or brainstorming ideas for my dream software company. Let’s connect and create something impactful together!
